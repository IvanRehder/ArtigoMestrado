Bradley and Dunlop published two works (\citeyear{bradley2002investigating,bradley2005experimental}) about how BVI navigates and how much it is similar or different to how a sighted person navigates. The first work of Bradley and Dunlop was published in \citeyear{bradley2002investigating} and discussed which type of information BVI uses to navigate in an environment and how it compares to sighted people. The second they compared the perceived workload of BVI participants and sighted participants when they navigate using user-tailored information created with the results of the previous experiments \cite{bradley2005experimental}. The results showed that BVI users reached landmarks significantly quicker when given the information made for that group, but still longer than sighted users. Also it showed that BVI participants systematically have a higher workload than sighted participants and that BVI users did have a higher workload when guided by orientations provided by sighted people, as well as the sighted participants did with orientations from BVI.
