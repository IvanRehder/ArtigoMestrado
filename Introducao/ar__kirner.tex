\cite{kirner2011using} raised two questions, "How can blind people learn 3D concepts aiming to be able to convert explored 3D environments into pictures?" and "How can we develop a spatial audio tutor with augmented reality technology to make easy the understanding of 3D concepts by blind people?" and used not using virtual reality technology but augmented reality to answer them. They developed a augmented reality application to be a tutor for BVI users. The application used allowed BVI users to play audio streams that were associeated with spatial positions. The users learned 3D concepts and also were able to  perceive, understand and produce embossed pictures representing real and imaginary 3D scenes. Also they were able to understand descriptions of 3D scenes described by non-BVI people. The authors believe that this application can be evolved to explain other concepts such as colors, transparency, shades, etc.
